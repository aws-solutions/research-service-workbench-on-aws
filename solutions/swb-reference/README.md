# Setup Instructions for RWB

Follow the instructions below to deploy RWB with Sagemaker Notebook lifecycle support. You'll be able to 
launch/start/stop/terminate/connect to a Sagemaker Notebook instance.

## Prerequisite
* An AWS account for deploying RWB API. This account will be called the `Main Account`.
   * On the command line, set your [credential file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) to have your `Main Account` as the `default` profile 
* An AWS account for hosting environments. This account will be called the `Hosting Account`. The `Hosting Account` must be different from `Main Account`.
* Software
  * [Rush](https://rushjs.io/pages/developer/new_developer/) v5.62.1 or later. We'll be using this tool to manage the packages in our mono-repo
  * Node 14.x or 16.x [(compatible node versions)](https://github.com/aws-solutions/research-service-workbench-on-aws/blob/main/rush.json#L9)
  * [POSTMAN](https://www.postman.com/) (Optional) This is used for making API requests to the server. POSTMAN is not needed if you already have a preferred API client. 
* The requirements below are for running the lambda locally 
   * Install SAM CLI ([link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html))
   * Install Docker ([link](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

## Installation
### Setup Config File
1. Navigate to `solutions/swb-reference`.
1. Copy `src/config/example.yaml` and create a new file in the format `<STAGE>.yaml` in the config folder. The stage value uniquely identifies this deployment. Some common values that can be used are `dev`, `beta`, and `gamma`.
1. Open your new `<STAGE>.yaml` file and uncomment the `stage` attribute. Provide the correct `<STAGE>` value for the attribute
1. Open your new `<STAGE>.yaml` file and uncomment `awsRegion` and `awsRegionShortName`. `aws-region` value can be one of the values on this [table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html#Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.Regions), under the `Region` column. `awsRegionName` can be a two or three letter abbreviation for that region, of your own choosing. The `awsRegion` value will determine which region RWB is deployed in.
1. Uncomment `rootUserEmailParamStorePath` and provide a name for a SSM parameter that will contain the main account user's email address, e.g. `/rsw/<stage>/rootUser/email`.
1. Follow instructions to [create a SSM Parameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-create-console.html) in your main account and set the name as the assigned value in `rootUserEmailParamStorePath` and the value as the main account user's email address.
1. Uncomment `allowedOrigins` and provide a list of URLs that will be allowed to access your RSW API, e.g. ['http://localhost:3000','http://localhost:3002'].
1. Uncomment `cognitoDomain` and provide a **globally unique** string that will be used for the cognito domain. This should be an alphanumeric string (hyphens allowed) that does not conflict with any other existing cognito domains.
1. If running your Lambda locally, `userPoolId`, `clientId`, and `clientSecret` will need to be set after the first execution of `cdk-deploy` as seen below under "Deploy the code". You will then need to re-run `STAGE=<STAGE> rushx cdk-deploy`.
1. If your SWB instance is going to use a custom network, uncomment `vpcId` and `albSubnetIds` and provide their respective values from your network.
1. Uncomment `albInternetFacing` and set it's value true if you want an internet-facing ALB instance, otherwize set to false.
1. Uncomment `hostedZoneId` and `domainName` and provide their respective values from your Hosted Zone. If you dont have a domain configured, follow instructions to [create a Hosted Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/CreatingHostedZone.html).
1. Run `chmod 777 <STAGE>.yaml` to allow local script to read the file


### Setup CDK
We'll be using AWS CDK to deploy our code to AWS. Follow the steps below to onboard CDK onto your AWS `Main Account`.

In `swb-reference` root directory run the follow code
```bash
rush install
rush build
rushx compile
STAGE=<STAGE> rushx cdk bootstrap
```

After bootstrap is completed you'll see a message like this
```bash
Found configuration in /Users/<user>/workplace/research-service-workbench-on-aws/rush.json

Rush Multi-Project Build Tool 5.62.1 - Node.js 14.17.0 (LTS)
> "cdk bootstrap"

 ⏳  Bootstrapping environment aws://123456789012/ap-northeast-3...
Trusted accounts for deployment: (none)
Trusted accounts for lookup: (none)
Using default execution policy of 'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess'. Pass '--cloudformation-execution-policies' to customize.
CDKToolkit: creating CloudFormation changeset...
 ✅  Environment aws://123456789012/ap-northeast-3 bootstrapped.
```

### Deploy the code
In `swb-reference` root directory run the following code

```bash
STAGE=<STAGE> rushx cdk-deploy              # Deploy code to `Main Account` on AWS
```
Take note of the following Cloudformation outputs. We will be using them in future steps.
```
S3BucketArtifactsArnOutput
AccountHandlerLambdaRoleOutput
ApiLambdaRoleOutput
StatusHandlerLambdaRoleOutput
APIGatewayAPIEndpoint
DataSetsBucketName
```

Run the post deployment step
```
STAGE=<STAGE> rushx run-postDeployment      # Setup Service Catalog portfolio and products
```
After post deployment is complete a temporary password will be sent to the main account user's email, take note of the temporary password as its going to be needed for API authenticated requests.

## Deploy to the Hosting Account
After the deployment succeeds, we will need to set up the `Hosting account`
1. Log into your AWS `Hosting Account` and go to Cloudformation
1. Choose to create a new stack. On the prompt `Create Stack`, choose `Upload a template file`. 
1. Upload the corresponding .yaml file from [templates](./src/templates) depending on your installation type. Default installation uses [onboard-account.cfn.yaml](./src/templates/onboard-account.cfn.yaml), for more customizable network options, refer to [Hosting Account Templates](./src/templates/README.md)
1. For the stack name, use the following value: `rsw-<stage>-<awsRegionShortName>-hosting-account`, for example `rsw-dev-va-hosting-account`
1. For the parameters provide the following values
```yaml
Namespace: rsw-<stage>-<awsRegionShortName>      # These values should be the same as in your config file
MainAccountId: <12 digit Account ID of Main Account>
ExternalId: <externalIdValue>  # An arbitrary unique ID used to identify this account
VpcCidr: 10.0.0.0/16
PublicSubnetCidr: 10.0.0.0/19
AccountHandlerRoleArn: <CFN_OUTPUT.AccountHandlerLambdaRoleOutput> 
ApiHandlerRoleArn: <CFN_OUTPUT.ApiLambdaRoleOutput> 
EnableFlowLogs: true
LaunchConstraintPolicyPrefix: *
LaunchConstraintRolePrefix: *
StatusHandlerRoleArn: <CFN_OUTPUT.StatusHandlerLambdaRoleOutput>
```

After the deployment is complete, take note of the following Cloudformation outputs. The outputs are on the `Outputs` tab. We will be using in future steps
```
HostingAccountHandlerRoleArn
EncryptionKeyArn
EnvMgmtRoleArn
VPC
VpcSubnet
```
### Configuring App Registry applications limits(Optional)

If you are estimating to have less than 999 Workspaces created in your Service Workbench instance, you can skip this step. 

Research Service Workbench on AWS uses [AWS App Registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/arguide/intro-app-registry.html) applications to group and add metadata and attributes to created resources.
By using App Registry, Research Service Workbench is able to organize its resources and track their dependencies more efficiently.
Every resource created in Research Service Workbench is associated to an App Registry application including all workspaces.
App Registry currently has a default limit of 1000 resources per application.

If you are estimating to have more than 999 Workspaces created in your Research Service Workbench instance a service quota increase will be needed.
Follow these steps to request a quota increase for App Registry application resources:

1. Sign in to your **Hosting Account** in the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?nc2=h_ct&src=header-signin).

1. Open the [**Service Quotas console**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home).

2. Click **AWS Services** in the menu bar on the left side to enter the search screen. 

1. In the search screen, enter `AWS Service Catalog` and choose **AWS Service Catalog** from the results.

1. Under **Services Quota**, choose **Resources per application**.

1. On the **Resources per application** page, choose **Request Quota Increase** under **Recent quota increase requests**.

1. In **Change quota**, enter your estimated number of workspaces plus 1 (infrastructure resource).

1. Choose **Request**.

## POSTMAN Setup
In POSTMAN create an environment using the instructions [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/#creating-environments).
Your environment should have four variables. Name the first one `API_URL` and the value should be the `APIGatewayAPIEndpoint` value from [Deploy the code step](#deploy-the-code).

Name the second, third and fourth ones `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `CSRF_COOKIE`, and `CSRF_TOKEN` and their values should be the `accessToken`, `csrfCookie`, and `csrfToken` you got from [Setup UI and Get Access Token](#setup-ui-and-get-access-token)

Import [RSW Postman Collection](./RWB.postman_collection.json). Instructions for how to import a collection is [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#importing-data-into-postman)


## Setup Account Resources
### Onboard hosting account
In **RSW Official** Postman Collection under **hosting account** folder choose **Create Hosting Account** API to onboard a hosting account. 
Remember to fill in the correct values for your account.
Custom values that needed to be provided by you will be `<INSIDE THIS>`

In the body tab set `envMgmtRoleArn` parameter to the `EnvMgmtRoleArn` value from [Deploy to the Hosting Account step](#deploy-to-the-hosting-account).

In the body tab set `hostingAccountHandlerRoleArn` parameter to the `HostingAccountHandlerRoleArn` value from [Deploy to the Hosting Account step](#deploy-to-the-hosting-account).


Send a **Create Hosting Account** request 

POST `{{API_URL}}/aws-accounts`
```json
{
    "name": "<Unique account name>",
    "awsAccountId": "<Hosting Account 12 Digit ID>",
    "envMgmtRoleArn": "<CFN_OUTPUT.EnvMgmtRoleArn>",
    "hostingAccountHandlerRoleArn": "<CFN_OUTPUT.HostingAccountHandlerRoleArn>",
    "externalId": "workbench"
}
```
Once the request excecute successfully a response with the following format will be displayed
```json
{
    "id": "acc-########-####-####-####-############",
    "name": "<Unique account name>",
    "awsAccountId": "<Hosting Account 12 Digit ID>",
    "envMgmtRoleArn": "<CFN_OUTPUT.EnvMgmtRoleArn>",

    "createdAt": "2023-03-07T22:31:40.783Z"
}
```
Take note of the `id` that was returned. We'll need it for the next step. We'll refer to this value as `ACCOUNT_ID`.

Wait for account handler to run. It runs once every 5 minutes. You'll know that it's completed when the account status is listed as `CURRENT`.

To monitor the account status, in **RSW Official** Postman Collection under **hosting account** folder choose **Get Hosting Account** API.

In the params tab set accountId parameter to the `ACCOUNT_ID` value from previous step and send request.

A response with the status property will be displayed 
```json

### Implement Integreation tests

To use the framework for calling the RSW API, create a `ClientSession` and then use the `resources` attribute to call the `CRUD` commands

Example code for creating new user

```ts
const setup: Setup = new Setup();
const adminSession = await setup.getDefaultAdminSession();
const { data } = await adminSession.resources.users.create({
      firstName: '<first name>',
      lastName: '<Last name>',
      email: `<email address>`
    });
```

Example code for GET one user

```ts
const setup: Setup = new Setup();
const adminSession = await setup.createAdminSession();
const userId = 'userId';
const { data: user } = await adminSession.resources.users.user(userId).get();
```

Example code for GETTING all users

```ts
const setup: Setup = new Setup();
const adminSession = await setup.createAdminSession();
const { data: response } = await adminSession.resources.users.get();
```

## Reset User Password
1. Go to the [Amazon Cognito console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home) in your main account. If prompted, enter your AWS credentials.
1. Choose **User Pools**.
1. Choose your SWB user pool with name `rsw-userpool-<STAGE>-<Region>`.
1. Choose the **App integration** tab.
1. Under **App client list** choose SWB app client with name `swb-client-<STAGE>-<Region>`.
1. Under **Hosted UI** choose **View Hosted UI**.
1. If the user has a temporary password, login with your user crendentials and you will be prompted to set a new password.
1. If the user already has a non temporary password follow instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-hosted-ui-user-forgot-password.html) to reset password.

## Obtain Access Token for making authenticated API requests
1. If you are tying to get a token from a user that still has its temporary password assigned please follow instructions [here](#reset-user-password) to reset user password.
1. Go to `swb-reference/scripts` folder
1. Pull down all required dependencies by running `rushx build`
1. Run `STAGE=<STAGE> node generateCognitoTokens.js <userName> '<password>'` with the correct value for `<userName>` and `<password>`. It should be a user that has been created for your SWB deployment. Note, the quotes around `<password>` is necessary for the script to correctly parse passwords that have symbols in it. 
1. In the console output, use the `accessToken`, `csrfCookie`, and `csrfToken` that are provided to make authenticated API requests. (Note: csrf token is only required for state changing requests)


## Running Code Locally
### Requirements
1. Install SAM CLI ([link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html))
1. Install Docker ([link](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

If you have made changes to the `environment` package or the `swb-reference` package follow these steps

1. In `research-service-workbench-on-aws` root directory run `rush build`
1. In `research-service-workbench-on-aws/solutions/swb-reference` root directory run `STAGE=<STAGE TO RUN LOCALLY> ./scripts/runLocally.sh`. This will run a local lambda server.


## Troubleshooting Guides

[Workspace Lifecycle Troubleshooting Guide](docs/WorkspaceLifecycleTroubleshootingGuide.md).

## Appendix
### Cloudwatch Logs
* `rsw-<stage>-<awsRegionShortName>-apiLambda`: Logs for api lambda. This lambda gets executed when user makes a request to rsw APIs. 
* `rsw-<stage>-<awsRegionShortName>-accountHandlerLambda`: Logs for account handler lambda. This lamba runs every 5 minutes and is responsible for keeping the hosting account resources in sync with the main account. 
* `rsw-<stage>-<awsRegionShortName>-statusHandlerLambda`: Logs for status handler lambda. This lambda is triggered by EventBridge events that originated in hosting accounts. It updates DDB with environment statuses from the hosting accounts.

## FAQ

1. **Why is there `jest.config.js` and `config/jest.config.json`?**

* `config/jest.config.json` is the settings for unit tests in the `src` folder
* `jest.config.js` is the settings for tests in `integration-tests`. These tests require setup steps that are not required by unit tests in the `src` folder.

2. **When I try to run the code locally or deploy the code, I'm getting dependency errors between the local packages.**

The `lib` folders for your project might have been deleted. Try running `rush purge; rush build` in the root
directory of this project to build the `lib` folders from scratch.

3. **How do I see which line of code my unit tests did not cover?**

Run `rushx jest --coverage`

4. **Why am I'm getting the error "Cannot find module in `common/temp`"?**

Your `node_modules`  might have been corrupted. Try the following command

```bash
rush purge
rush install
rush build
```
