# `AWS ParallelClusters API Backend on SWB`

## Requirements
The requirements utilizing the HPC backend on SWB:
1. Deploy Pcluster Manager stack and deploy clusters to Hosting Account. 
Instructions for deploying the stack can be found [here](https://pcluster.cloud/01-getting-started.html). Information on creating clusters are also here in [this video review of Pcluster Manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1vlpJYb1KQ).
2. Deploy ParallelCluster Stack API onto the Hosting Account under the region for the
where your clusters reside such as `us-east-1`. Use version `3.14` of [ParallelCluster Stack API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/api-reference-v3.html). 

## Set Up
1. In the root directory at `ma-mono` run `rush install`
2. Copy `src/config/example.yaml` and create a new file in the format `<STAGE>.yaml` in the config folder
3. Uncomment the `stage` attribute and provide the correct `<STAGE>` value for the attribute
4. Uncomment `awsRegion` and `awsRegionShortName`. `aws-region` value can be one of the values on this [table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html#Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.Regions), under the `Region` column. `awsRegionName` can be a two or three letter abbreviation for that region, of your own choosing.
5. Uncomment `rootUserEmail` and provide the main account user's email address
6. Uncomment `parallelClusterApiURL` and provide API endpoint to ParallelCluster API stack. Deployed in same region as its corresponding clusters.
7. Run `chmod 777 <STAGE>.yaml` to allow local script to read the file

## Running Code Locally
If you have made changes to the `environment` package or the `swb-reference` package follow these steps
1. In `ma-mono` root directory run `rush build`
2. In `ma-mono/solutions/swb-reference` root directory run `STAGE=<STAGE TO RUN LOCALLY> ./scripts/runLocally.sh`. This will run a local lambda server.

## Deploying Code
Run one time to Bootstrap the CDK

`STAGE=<STAGE> rushx cdk bootstrap`

Deploy/Update code

`STAGE=<STAGE TO DEPLOY> rushx cdk-deploy`

## Run Post Deployment 
This step is necessary to setup Service Catalog portfolio and products

`STAGE=<STAGE> rushx run-postDeployment`

## FAQ
1. **Why is there `jest.config.js` and `config/jest.config.json`?**
* `config/jest.config.json` is the settings for unit tests in the `src` folder
* `jest.config.js` is the settings for tests in `integration-tests`. These tests require setup steps that are not required by unit tests in the `src` folder.

2. **When I try to run the code locally or deploy the code, I'm getting dependency errors between the local packages.**

The `lib` folders for your project might have been deleted. Try running `rush purge; rush build` in the root 
directory of this project to build the `lib` folders from scratch. 

3. **How do I see which line of code my unit tests did not cover?**

Run `rushx jest --coverage`

4. **Why am I'm getting the error "Cannot find module in `common/temp`"?**

Your `node_modules`  might have been corrupted. Try the following command
```
rush purge
rush install
rush build
```
