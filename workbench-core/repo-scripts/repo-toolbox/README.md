# # Workbench Core Repo-toolbox

⚠️ $\textcolor{red}{\text{Experimental}}$ ⚠️ : Not for use in any critical, production, or otherwise important deployments

## Description
Most mono-repositories contain a top-level `README.md` file which outlines the contents and goals of the repository. Individual packages within the larger repository also have `README.md` files which describe the contents and usage of that package. The `repo-toolbox` provides a command-line driven tool for adding a convenient lookup table to the repository's top-level `README.md` which lists
- Folder: the path to each package in the solution
- Package: the `package.json` defined `name` for each package.
- README: a link to the `README.md` file for that package.

The following example is a snapshot from the [research-service-workbench-on-aws README.md](https://github.com/aws-solutions/research-service-workbench-on-aws/blob/main/README.md).

## Usage
This package was built for use with a 'Rush' monorepo and this usage documentation will assume you are using rush.

Edit the top-level `README.md` file and add necessary tags for the `repo-toolbox` `readme` tool to locate the area where the table should be placed.

```md
<!-- GENERATED PROJECT SUMMARY START -->

<!-- GENERATED PROJECT SUMMARY END -->
```

Use the `install-run-rushx.js` script from the `Rush` repository `common` folder to execute the `readme` action from within the project folder. The following script can be used within a CICD mechanism to keep the README up to date. Paths are relative to the root of the `research-service-workbench-on-aws` repository.

```bash
cd workbench-core/repo-scripts/repo-toolbox
node ../../../common/scripts/install-run-rushx.js readme -v || exit_status=$?
if [[ $exit_status != 0 ]]; then
  node ../../../common/scripts/install-run-rushx.js readme
fi
```
