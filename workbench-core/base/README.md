> This package is intended to provide a base AWS Service class that encapsulates all the service clients and commands that the application currently requires. We use `aws-sdk` V3 to improve the load-time of the modules imported at runtime.

## Usage

```
import { AwsService } from '@aws/workbench-core-base';
const aws = new AwsService({ region: 'us-east-1' });
const params = { StackName: 'testStack' };                            // construct params
const response = await aws.cloudformation.describeStacks(params);     // perform SDK call
```
